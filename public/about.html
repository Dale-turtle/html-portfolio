<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a very happy person who is hard working and enjoys learning new things</p>

<p>My hobbies include reading comics, playing boardgames, card games, building models and playing DND. 
  I have recently started a DND comunity at my local gaming store. 
  There have been a few challanges in starting a community but the rewards are well worth it. </p>
